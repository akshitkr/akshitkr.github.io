I like Iosevka, the condensed letters look really pretty to
me.

Mandatory emacs snippet:
```racket
(set-frame-font "-*-Iosevka-regular-normal-normal-*-12-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1")
```

Looks alright on the displays I typically use.

Apparently C-k doesn't work globally, Mac *deletes* the lines but doesn't 
put them in the kill ring (the clipboard), more reasons to just stay inside emacs.
