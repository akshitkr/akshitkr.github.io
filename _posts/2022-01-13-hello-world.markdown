I've been meaning to set up a blog for a long time, finally went around caring enough about it to actually set it up and deploy. The blog also coincides with the January 1st (we're _13_ days late actually but lets just ignore that for a moment), so a Happy New Years to you too. <br><br>This is my first year going to university and I'm really excited for obvious reasons, its only been a few months into online uni and I already think it should be mandatory for every person to go because of how inexplicably wonderful the experience is. Really a shame how this opportunity is stolen from the vast majority, the student debt in America is a grave social issue at large, a university education opens up a million doors (physically and metaphorically), not only that, its a completely different world inside, people from extremely differing backgrounds (alright, not _[always](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/9/15/harvard-skews-wealthy-freshman-survey/)_ true) coming together makes up for a great learning experience especially when most don't have a job to go to and can _waste_ their time on learning the ropes and making memories. <br>

Anyway, this was supposed to be a placeholder post. If you're looking to chat, I'm eternally active on discord â€“ komikat#5603, a few other socials are linked in the footer.
