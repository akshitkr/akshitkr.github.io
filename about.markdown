## ˈfəːmən
firman is my personal blog encompassing everything which interests me. <br>The word firman can be loosely translated to `royal edict` in Persian, the language of courts in the Mughal Empire.
<br><br>
The blog itself runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in ruby, using the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme – hosted on Github pages.
