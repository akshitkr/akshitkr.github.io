Hi I'm a Computer Science freshman at IIIT Hyderabad, I'm interested in a lot of things but particularly computer science, maths, history and geopolitics.

This blog runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in ruby, using the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme – hosted on Github pages.
