I was given a folder of python2 files to work with for 
a task required to be done for my lab (LTRC, IIIT-H). 

The files, of course, had issues -- they were written
some time ago by people no longer associated
with the project. The issues weren't really unsolvable
in any way. 

Most of them involved `file_not_found` -- probably
due to a path issue or some variable lacking a parameter.

```
python2 TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```

This is kinda where I had an epiphany -- to never use a 
language without static types for a codebase intended to be 
used for a time period longer than a few weeks. 

Most of these issues simply would not have existed 
if a language with static typing was used, saving time in the future (at this moment).
Even if static types come with a time penalty during the development period,
the benefits are reaped later when reviving the project years later.
