#### Update: pls use [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)

I was given a folder of python2 files to work with for 
a task required to be done for my lab (LTRC, IIIT-H). 

The files, of course, had issues -- they were written
some time ago by people no longer associated
with the project. The issues weren't really unsolvable
in any way. 

Most of them involved `file_not_found` -- probably
due to a path issue or some variable lacking a parameter.

```python2
TypeError: 'bool' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
```


Most of these issues simply would not have existed 
if a language with static typing was used, saving time in the future (at this moment).
