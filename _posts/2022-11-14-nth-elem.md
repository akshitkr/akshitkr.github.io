Racket doesn't have a "standard" way of accessing elements 
in a list -- probably because LISP lists aren't really lists, 
just an illusion built on cons cells which hold a pair of values.

```racket
(cons "one" "second") ; '("one" "second")
```

This function can then be recursed over to concatenate an element with 
a returned pair of elements like this,

```racket
(cons 3 (cons "one" "second")) ; '(3 . ("one" . "second"))
```

The first value is called *CAR* and the other is called *CDR* --
mnemonic names for the people working on the first lisp, they don't really
make any sense now.

```racket
(car (cons 3 (cons "one" "second"))) ; 3
(cdr (cons 3 (cons "one" "second"))) ; '("one" . "second")

(car (cdr (cons 3 (cons "one" "second")))) ; "one"
```

I like doing it this way -- signifying invalid access by returning an `#f`.

```racket
(define (cnr l n)
  (if (not (equal? l '()))
      (if (equal? n 0) (car l)
          (cnr (cdr l) (- n 1))
          )
      (error 'cnr "out of bounds")
      )
  )
```
